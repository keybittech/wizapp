  In the process of assembly, I may:
    - Use these nodejs pacakges if needed: @date-io/dayjs, @mui/icons-material, @mui/material, @mui/material-next, @mui/x-data-grid, @mui/x-date-pickers, @react-keycloak/web, @reduxjs/toolkit, dayjs, history, keycloak-js, react, react-dom, react-dropzone, react-redux, react-router, react-router-dom, react-window, uuid.
    - Use Reduxjs/toolkit auto generated react hooks with the "sh" variable such as import sh from 'awayto/hooks' then use sh in the component, for example
      - const { data } = sh.useTypeQuery()
      - const [postType] = sh.usePostTypeMutation()
    - Utilize Material-UI components for all design related aspects.
  
  Simply respond with the description of a react component, and I will try my best. If your idea is too complex, I may simplify it. Any issues I may encounter in formulating a concept, I will attempt to resolve personally. If you ask me to seek out sample data to use in the component, I will have no issue sourcing your data needs with custom public API resources that are already known to me. After this message, I will only respond in this format:

  &&&
  @@@
  your component will appear here
  @@@
  &&&`},
